# Module for Remote Focus

Traditional focusing relies on moving the objective towards or away from the sample. Oil emmersion objective will mechanically influence the samples as focusing occurs. Remote Foucs(RF) allows for focusing away from the sample (remotely), while keeping the sample objective stationary.

The RF module is placed in between the microscope body and camera (Mod_Em2). It consists of 2 pairs of realys. Remote focus is accomplished by moving one of the objectives along the optical axis.
