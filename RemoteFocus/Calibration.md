# Calibration Protocol for Remote Focus

## Lateral calibration

1. Place measuring ruler on xy-stage
2. Acquire a focused image
3. Calculate um/px

## Axial calibration

1. Place measuring ruler on an angle with a 3D printed stand.
2. Acquire images at different Z depths using the axial calibration script on micromanager.
3. Calculate Z as a function of motor movement.
