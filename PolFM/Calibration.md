# Calibration Protocol for PolFM on IX83

## Excitation Polarization Calibration

1. Select the correct confocal calibration plate (Chroma) based on excitation wavelength.
2. Place linear polarized filter at back port of IX83. Orient the filter so that the camera detects maximum intensity.
3. Place module in its position in the excitation light path. 
4. Run the PolFM calibration script on micromanager. It will take a series of images while changing the voltage to the liquid crystal retarder.
5. Run calibration scripts to find V for par and perp states.
