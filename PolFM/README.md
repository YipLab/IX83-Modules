# Module for Polarized Fluoresence Microscopy

Most fluorophores have a preferential polarization.  Hence fluorophore orientation can be observed by exciting with parallel and perpendicular excitation in succession.

The PolFM module is placed in Mod_Ex1, and is designed to rotate the laser between parallel and perpendicular excitations. The laser beam travels through a 1/4 wave plate which spins the laser polarization from linear to circular polarized. Then a liquid crystal retarder is used convert the beam back to a linear polarization in either directions.
