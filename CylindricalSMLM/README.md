# Module for Motorized Cylindrical Lens for Single Molecule Localization Microscopy

Traditional Single Molecule Localization Micrsocopy (SMLM) techniques have generate a 2D super-resolution image. Several tehcniques have been developed for 3D SMLM, most revolve around PSF engineering. Perhaps the most simple method to 3D SMLM is the addition of a cylindrical lens that introduces astigmatism to the PSF.

The Motorized Cylindrical SMLM module is placed in between the camera and microscope body, Mod_Em2.  The cylindrical lens is attached to a stepper motor that actuates back and forth movement along the optical axis. By moving the cylindrical lens, we are able to tune the axial range and sensitivity of the system.
